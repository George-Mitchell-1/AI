# Free Cell
A* Search algorithm implemented on a mutilated Free Cell game. There exists a counter and some number of piles which contain counting numbers. Each turn you can move a number from the top of its pile to the top of a pile with a smaller numbered leading value. Alternatively, you can take a number out of the game and decrement the counter if the number matches the counter and is on top of its pile.
